# 专英作业01

## 无注释原文
Computers will become more advanced and they will also become easier to use. Improved speech recognition will make the operation of a computer easier. Virtual reality (虚拟现实), the technology of interacting with a computer using all of the human senses, will also contribute to better human and computer interfaces (界面，接口). Other, exotic (奇异的) models of computation are being developed, including biological computing that uses living organisms, molecular (分子的) computing that uses molecules with particular properties, and computing that uses DNA, the basic unit of heredity (遗传), to store data and carry out operations. These are examples of possible future computational platforms that, so far, are limited in abilities or are strictly theoretical. Scientists investigate them because of the physical limitations of miniaturizing (使小型化) circuits embedded in silicon. There are also limitations related to heat generated by even the tiniest of transistors.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) research seeks to enable computers and machines to mimic human intelligence and sensory processing ability, and models human behavior with computers to improve our understanding of intelligence. The many branches of AI research include machine learning, inference, cognition, knowledge representation, problem solving, case-based reasoning, natural language understanding, speech recognition, computer vision, and artificial neural networks.
